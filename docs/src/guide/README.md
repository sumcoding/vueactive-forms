# Introduction

Vueactive forms is a simple model based validator utilizing the [Reactivity API](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/basic-reactivity.html).
It is decoupled from templates and allows for custom stylings and interactions. It is similar to vuelidate in this way, but does not completely separate itself from the model data as that does.

It is loosely based off of both vueladate and angulars reactive forms.
